<h2>Top two cultural shocks I've experienced</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The public transportation is a lot different from my country. At the beginning I didn't even know how to make the bus stop.
        So it was really weird and the first time I went for two more stops before figuring out that you only have to pull a cord.
    </li>
    <li>
        When I went to the library it was a little bit weird for me because. I didn't really know how to print something.
        I have to ask the people working there, at first they looked me as I was trying to make a joke but then they understood that i really didn't know so they helped.
    </li>

</ul>

<h2>Top two things I miss most</h2>
<ul>
    <li>My family of course, they are the most important people of my whole life so it's difficult not having them around. 
        We speak almost dayly but It's not the same, sometimes I just want to have a hug of them and I know that everything will be fine.
        I really miss them.
    </li>
    <li>
        The food is also a huge thig that I really miss, even I know how to cook. it isn't the same, sometimes it's difficult to find the ingredients or if you found them they taste different.
    </li>

</ul>
